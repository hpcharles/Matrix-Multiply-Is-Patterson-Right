# Matrix-Multiply-Is-Patterson-Right

## Idea ##

This small project is an educationnal project. The idea is to show the
performance improvement for a simple algorithm between an
implementation in

* an interpreted version (naive python),
* a C naive version
* a C optimized for memory access
* a C optimized for memory access with vectorized operators (AVX)

This is NOT
* an optimized version for all platforms,
* an optimized version for all intel platforms

This is just a tutorial to show the impact in term of performances of
different optimization approaches and to verify that Pattersion is
right about performance improvment (see slide "There is plenty room at
the top" in the video)
